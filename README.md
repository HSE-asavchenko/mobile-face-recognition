## Models
We provide several publicly available lightweight models for [face recognition](models/face_recognition) and [facial expression recognition](models/face_expressions) that obtained high accuracy of LFW (Labeled Faces in-the-Wild) and AffectNet datasets.

## Mobile demo
The demo Android application is available at our [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D6z7zeWxFXh63Njm9Y4t4Kt1uf5OfgrT?usp=sharing). Here is the result of its running on my personal device:
